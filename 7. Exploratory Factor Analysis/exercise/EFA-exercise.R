###     EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS    ###  
###             EXERCISE               ###
##########################################

# The correlation matrix given below are from
# scores of 220 boys in six school subjects:
# (1) French; (2) English; (3) History;
# (4) Arithmetic; (5) Algebra and (6) Geometry

# Find the two-factor solution from an ML
# factor analysis. Interpret the factor loadings.
# Then plot these derived loadings and interpret.
# Finally, find an non-orthogonal rotation that
# allows easier interpretation of the results
# looking at the factor loadings directly, without
# the "visual utility" that is afforded by plotting
# the two-factor solution first.
